Besides email, college administrators, staff, and students don’t have the best means of communication. Our project will solve these problems. Our plan is to create an application that allows students, staff and administrators to communicate and collaborate via our application. Our application will show the most recent announcements, alerts, and more.

## Initial Features
1.  Allows students to create posts and have comments, but “verified/moderator” accounts show up on the top of comments
2.  Allows tags to be added and allows filtering based on the tags
3.  Allows picture uploading for posts
4.  Allows rooms to be created for posts such as different classrooms, clubs, and more.
